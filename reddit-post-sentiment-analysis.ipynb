       " \"Seeing so many comments on this sub calling Barcelona out for replacing Suarez and then going for Aguero a year later. So this is my try at educating people on the circumstances surrounding the transfer.\\n\\n1. Luis Suarez earned close to 21 million euros a year. And he had 1 year left on his deal with a clause in his contract that automatically extended his contract by 1 more year if he played 50% of the games in that season. Aguero is on 8 million euros gross with performance bonuses and a CL bonus. \\n2. Luis Suarez is 2 years older than Aguero and despite being a deadly finisher in the box, lacked heavily in almost every other facet of the game. He couldn't dribble past opponents, didn't have the workrate to put in a defensive shift like Griezmann does. He relies on service into the box, the kind which Atletico can provide with the brilliant Carrasco and Correa. \\n3. Barcelona scored 86 goals with Suarez in 2019/20, and 85 goals without Suarez in 2020/21. So you could argue that Griezmann stepped up massively and if Ansu Fati hadn't been injured, Barcelona would've outscored their last season tally by a significant amount. \\n4. Martin Braithwaite is the club's only true number 9 and is now used as a rotation/bench option. According to sources in the press, both Braithwaite and Barcelona have agreed that he will leave. This transfer made scant sense in the first place, with Bartomeu splashing the cash to sign a player who isn't good enough to play for Barcelona. Aguero is being brought in to replace Braithwaite as the bench option.\\n5. Atletico Madrid paid Barcelona 7 million for Luis Suarez. This fee could rise to a potential 13.2 million based on his performance add-ons. Conservative estimates for Braithwaite put his fee for a expected transfer around 5-10 million. Aguero is being signed on a free with no signing on bonus. With wages that are conservative and in-line for a bench option and someone who brings in revenue and shirt sales because he is a global superstar.\\n6. Lastly but most importantly, the people who sold Suarez and the people who bought Aguero are not the same. Remember Bartomeu, Laporta, the elections? It's not like Barcelona, the club, conducted all this transfer business. So it doesn't make any sense to treat Laporta's signing of Aguero as anything to do with Suarez because Suarez wasn't even at the club when Laporta arrived. This piece of business has to do with Laporta replacing Braithwaite with Aguero which is the biggest no-brainer I've seen in a long long long time. \\n\\nI know Aguero has had injury issues, but he scored 26 goals in the 2019-20 season. This season has been a bit of anomaly for him. And he isn't being brought in to start every game. Griezmann brings too much to the team to be benched for Aguero and he has 36 G+A for club and country this season. I fully expect Antoine to hit the 40-45 mark next season. \\n\\nSo as someone who is informed about all the circumstances around Aguero's transfer, I feel like it will be a Henrik Larsson type of signing which will be regarded as an astute piece of business at best. If he's injured, well, we shouldn't feel his absence because we have players who bring more to the table than him in attack\",\n",

While Silva is by far the best striker Frankfurt have had since Yeboah, we have Joveljic coming back after a super successful loan to Wolfsberg, in addition to Paciencia, who despite his atrocious season for Schalke has shown already that he can deliver with a good team behind him and Ragnar Ache, who hopefully stays fit.
